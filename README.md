- <h1>Hi my name's Dillon!</h1>
- I've been working as a 911 Dispatcher for several years while studying and building projects along the way.
- I have a magnetic attraction to puzzles of all kinds and programming really scratches that itch.

I've refactored several of my projects over time, but I also left more as they were to show my progression and learning as time has gone on, so when you look at the early repos... now you know.
