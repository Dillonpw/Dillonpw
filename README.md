- <h1>Hi my name's Dillon!</h1>
<p>I've been working as a 911 Dispatcher for several<br /> years while studying and building projects along the way.<br/>
I build things on the web with the hope that someone<br /> will see and enjoy what I've made.</p>

I've refactored several of my projects over time, but I also left more as they were to show my progression and learning as time has gone on, so when you look at the early repos... now you know.
